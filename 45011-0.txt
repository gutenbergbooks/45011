FOREWORD


The executive committee of the Naval History Society having decided
to publish for its initial volume the logs of the three ships
commanded by John Paul Jones during the years 1779 and 1780, the
owner has consented to edit this publication, with a description
of the book itself, together with its history, so far as it can be
ascertained, believing that it will add something of interest to
the voluminous records and the literature relating to the life and
services of the distinguished hero of our Revolutionary navy.

Besides these logs of the _Serapis_, _Alliance_, and _Ariel_, there
are, in the Library of the Navy Department, copies of the log of the
_Ranger_, beginning November 26, 1777, and ending May 18, 1778; also
of the log of the _Bon Homme Richard_, beginning at L'Orient May 18,
1779, and ending September 24, 1779.

The original log-books, as shown by notes and a copy of a letter
accompanying and attached to them, are stated to have been purchased
by Captain Boyd, of Greenock, from a person of the name of Harding,
a baker, in New York, in 1824; and to have been presented to Lady
Isabella Helen Douglas, daughter of the fifth Earl of Selkirk, by
William John, ninth Lord Napier, on March 17, 1830; they are now
supposed to rest among the manuscripts of the Selkirk family.

Had the editor known of the existence of this log of the _Bon Homme
Richard_, covering the period of her commissioning and cruise prior
to the engagement with the _Serapis_, he would have deemed it proper
to have included it in this publication. The information came to him
too late to have it fully transcribed and prepared for the printer. A
few excerpts from it are placed in the Appendix.[1]

[Footnote 1: See Appendix A.]

The log-book now published is one of the few relics known to exist
of the engagement between the _Bon Homme Richard_ and the _Serapis_,
as most of the records and official papers of both ships were lost
when the _Bon Homme Richard_ sank, or following the confusion on the
_Serapis_ after her capture.

The book is fourteen inches tall, nine and one quarter inches wide,
bound in old vellum, stained, warped, worn with age and hard usage on
land and sea. The paper is rough, greenish in color, the hand-made
linen paper of the period, with a watermark showing it to be of
English manufacture.

Upon the exterior of both covers are numerous scribblings:
"R. D. June 2d, 1779"--"R. D. June 26, 1779"--"Richard Dales
book"--"September the 3d--1780--This book belongs to Mr. Henry Lunt,
Lieutenant of the Ship of War, the (_Ariel_)." Richard Dale's name is
also found in several places on the pages of the book.

It was first used to enter the names of the officers and crew
of the _Bon Homme Richard_, giving their rank, rating, and the
dates and places of their enlistment.[2] It evidently constituted
the muster-roll of that ship when Robert Robinson was the first
lieutenant, and, after the dismissal of that officer by sentence of
court martial for "negligence of duty," it passed into the keeping of
Richard Dale, who succeeded Robinson as first lieutenant, he entering
therein, on the pages immediately following the muster-roll: "A List
of The Men Names that has Desarted from _The Bone Homme Richard_,
Lorient July, 19th. 1779"[3]

[Footnote 2: See p. 3.]

[Footnote 3: See p. 18.]

When the _Richard_ sank off Flamborough Head, the muster-roll was
saved and taken on board the _Serapis_, as constituting the official
list of those entitled to prize money--then as now the great
incentive to naval enlistment and activity.

As may well be imagined, a blank-book suitable for a log was
not available at that moment of supreme confusion, so that the
muster-roll book of the _Richard_, with only a few of its pages
in use, was seized upon and used to enter the daily transactions
on board the _Serapis_, from the time of her capture until, as a
result of the political situation between Holland and England, she
was turned over to the French, and, under the command of Captain
Cottineau, hoisted the French colors in the Texel Roads.

The book was reversed, and the log of the _Serapis_ begun at
the other end, preceded by a brief memorandum--"Some Remarkable
Occurrences that happened on the 23d day of September, 1779,"--which
briefly records the capture of the _Serapis_.

No other or more circumstantial account of the fight existed in
the book when it came into the possession of its later owners, but
a close examination showed that, besides minor mutilations, two
leaves, immediately preceding that containing the statement of "Some
Remarkable Occurrences," had, at some time, been torn out. In order
to incorporate into the book a clearer and more circumstantial
account of the fight, a former owner caused to be copied on several
blank leaves the narrative found amongst the Peter Force Collection
of Manuscripts, "John Paul Jones Papers," Volume VI, number 29.

The authorship and penmanship of this document have been ascribed by
various biographers of Jones to Richard Dale.[4]

[Footnote 4: Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Paul Jones, Edinburgh, 1830;
Professor Marion, John Paul Jones' Last Cruise and Final Resting
Place, Washington, 1906.]

The present owner's attention was specially called to it by seeing
a small photographic reproduction, published in a book by Professor
Marion entitled, "John Paul Jones' Last Cruise and Final Resting
Place," Washington, 1906. The author describes this valuable and
historical document as a "manuscript written on two pages of rough,
greenish paper, evidently torn out of a log book," and attributes it
to Richard Dale, the first lieutenant of the _Bon Homme Richard_.
The compiler of the "John Paul Jones Manuscripts" in the Library of
Congress attributes it possibly to Jones' secretary.[5] The author
of the "Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Paul Jones," published in Edinburgh
and London, 1830, Volume I, page 192, states "that the fact of
Landais' firing into the _Bon Homme Richard_ is also confirmed by
the log-book, which was preserved when the ship sunk, and by a very
interesting and seaman-like narrative of the engagement, drawn up by
Mr. Dale." He adds in a footnote in reference to the log-book: "This
battered volume, after many adventures by land and water, is now
(1830) in the possession of Mr. Richard Napier, Advocate."

[Footnote 5: Calendar of John Paul Jones Manuscripts, pp. 104, 105.]

As this author bases his book upon documents then in the possession
of Mrs. Jeanette Taylor, the sister of Paul Jones, which she came
into possession of when he died in Paris, the "battered volume"
referred to must have been amongst Jones' papers, and is undoubtedly
the same log-book now under review. As will be shown later, it was
surely in the possession of Richard Dale as late as 1782, and at some
time after the war he probably restored it to Jones, who certainly
had a good claim to it, as the muster-roll of the _Bon Homme
Richard_, contained in it, was necessary in the prosecution of his
prize-money claims in France.

However this may be, the present owner procured a photograph of the
narrative of the engagement, of the exact dimensions of the sheets
upon which it was written, and on comparison of these sheets with the
leaves of the log-book it was found that in dimensions, in the color
and quality of the paper, even in the indenture of the torn edges,
there could be no possible doubt that the document was torn from this
log-book, and found its way into the Peter Force Collection, and
thence to the possession of the Congressional Library. The facsimile
is now where the original was, and the narrative is included in this
publication of the _Serapis'_ log.[6] Still there was doubt as to
its authorship. A comparison of the handwriting with that of Richard
Dale, to whom it was attributed, showed conclusively that he was not
the writer. Amongst the various scribblings upon the covers of the
log-book is found:

     September the 3d, 1780. This book belongs to Mr. Henry
     Lunt, Lieutenant of the Ship of War, the (Ariel)

a memorandum undoubtedly written by Lunt himself, who was, on the
date named, the second lieutenant of the _Ariel_, commanded by Jones,
Dale being her first lieutenant.[7]

[Footnote 6: See p. 22 of log of _Serapis_.]

[Footnote 7: See List of Officers of _Ariel_, p. 20.]

Comparisons of letters of Henry Lunt, also in the Peter Force
Collection, with the narrative establish beyond any doubt that it is
the penmanship of Lieutenant Henry Lunt. Mr. Gaillard Hunt, chief of
the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress, in a letter to
the editor, in reply to his suggestion that Lunt may have been the
writer, states as follows:

     That the two pages of the _Serapis_ log are in the
     hand of Lieutenant Henry Lunt. They have been compared
     with a letter of Lunt to Jones, October 7, 1779, and
     there can be no question of the identity of the hand.

A few words as to Lieutenant Henry Lunt. As is well known, he was not
on board the _Bon Homme Richard_ during the engagement, having been
sent, with fifteen of the crew, to take possession of a brigantine
which had been chased inshore, and, although recalled by signal, he
did not return until after the action. His conduct in this respect
has been properly criticized. He states himself:

     Having, on the 23d of September, 1779, been ordered
     in a pilot boat with a party of men after a brig, but
     some time after I set out from alongside, a signal was
     made for me to return back to the _Bon homme Richard_,
     she being then in chase of two British ships-of-war,
     the _Serapis_ and _Countess of Scarborough_, and
     before I could get on board the _Bon homme Richard_
     she commenced the engagement with the _Serapis_. It
     being night, I thought it not prudent to go alongside
     in time of action....

This is signed, "On board the _Serapis_, at the Texel, 25th of
October, 1779. Henry Lunt."

Jones indorses this as follows:

     This certificate of Lieut. Lunt, who was a mere
     spectator, is of great weight and importance, it being
     only in the power of this gentleman to give a true
     account of the respective positions and manoeuvres of
     the ships engaged.

                                                       J. P. JONES.[8]

[Footnote 8: Sherburne's Life of Jones, New York, 1851, p. 164.]

The question naturally arises, Who dictated the narrative of the
fight which Lunt wrote in the _Serapis'_ log? It is an authentic and
truthful narration of the principal occurrences, and corresponds with
Jones' own accounts of the battle. It is written in the first person,
and must have been written by some one who was on board the _Bon
Homme Richard_, and copied by Lunt into the _Serapis'_ log at some
time subsequent to the engagement, in order to have a circumstantial
account recorded in the log. Lunt's statement that the log-book
belonged to him on September 3, 1780, when second lieutenant of the
_Ariel_, nearly a year after the fight, would lead us to suppose
that, as he was surrounded by the officers who were on the _Bon Homme
Richard_, he simply copied a description dictated by one of them,
probably by Jones himself, as the latter's well-known proclivity
for self-adulation would naturally show itself in a desire to have
his personal efforts spread upon the official record. It is further
worthy of note that almost the only tributes to the officers of the
_Bon Homme Richard_, or recognition of their services, are to be
found in Jones' charges and proofs against Landais, where his object
was to give force to their testimony.[9] His apparent unwillingness
to commend others, or award to each of his officers a just meed of
praise, has been noted by some of his biographers as his great fault.

[Footnote 9: Sherburne's Life of Jones, New York, 1851, pp. 156-171.]

It is a matter of interest to a collector to be able to identify the
author or writer of this narrative of the engagement, and to place
it, after a long separation, where it originally was written.

The first regular entry in the _Serapis'_ log is on the 26th of
September, when, dismasted, crowded with prisoners, and encumbered
with wounded, her people, assisted by men from the other ships of
the squadron, were employed in erecting jury masts and repairing
the damages sustained in the action. The wind was for several days
light, from the southwest, and the sea fairly smooth, the speed
recorded being from two to four knots. Jones decided to make the port
of Dunkirk, but his colleagues overruled him, and upon making the
land, owing to bad weather and contrary winds, the squadron, after
being tossed to and fro by contrary winds for seven days, anchored in
the Texel Roads on the 3d of October. That the ship should have been
safely taken to a harbor under such circumstances is not the least
of Jones' exploits as a seaman; while the failure of the English
cruisers to intercept and recapture her brought much obloquy upon the
British admiralty.

Safely anchored in the Texel, Sir Joseph Yorke, the British
ambassador at The Hague, who persistently referred to Jones as
"that pirate, Paul Jones: a rebel subject and criminal of State,"
immediately demanded the surrender of the prizes and the release of
the prisoners.[10] The demand was refused by the High Commissioners,
and after much correspondence Jones obtained permission, under
certain restrictions, to land his prisoners and wounded, and to mount
guard over them on an island in the Texel. Jones may fairly be said
to have added to his fame by being mainly instrumental in bringing
about an open rupture between England and Holland by the stand taken
by him during this trying period.

[Footnote 10: Sherburne's Life of Jones, New York, 1851, p. 129.]

As will be seen by the entries in the log, the crew, with assistance
from the other ships, were for many days busily employed in cleaning
up her decks and in repairing and refitting the ship. She was in a
dreadful condition of filth and disorder. Jones desired to refit her,
and again to cruise in English waters, as she was a fine, stanch
ship, recently built, and would have been a valuable substitute for
the lost _Richard_. Jones states that she was the best ship he ever
saw of her kind.

Complications between the Dutch and English governments, however,
became acute. Jones was ordered to sail from the Texel, then
blockaded by an English fleet, and the Dutch Admiral was ordered
to use forcible measures, if found necessary, to compel him to do
so. With Dr. Franklin's approval it was decided to turn over to
the French the prizes, and all the ships except the _Alliance_,
which, having been built in America, was accepted as a properly
commissioned Continental ship-of-war. In pursuance of this decision
Jones turned over to Captain Cottineau the command of the _Serapis_,
who hoisted the French flag over her on November 21, 1779. Landais
was deposed from the command of the _Alliance_, to which ship
Jones transferred his flag, having first stripped the _Serapis_
of everything movable and useful and sent the same on board the
_Alliance_.[11]

[Footnote 11: See log of _Serapis_ for November 21, 1779.]

The log-book now continues with "A Journall Kept on Board the
American Continental Frigate of War, _Alliance_, of 36 guns, under
the Command of the Honble. John Paul Jones, Commencing in the Road of
Texel in Holland."

Commencing on the 22d of November, the log states the daily
occurrences until June 12, 1780. According to Jones' account the ship
was in a deplorable condition, which he attributed to the incapacity
of Landais, whom he had supplanted, and with whom he was on bad
terms, having charged him with being responsible, in part, for the
collision with the _Richard_ on her first cruise; with cowardice
during the action with the _Serapis_; with intentionally firing
upon the _Richard_; with disobedience of orders, disrespect, and
insolence. Jones states that the _Alliance_ had not a good cable
or sail; the officers and men were intemperate and idle; filth,
insubordination, and epidemic diseases prevailed among the crew; she
was badly supplied with arms; and her powder was of bad quality. Some
of these deficiences Jones supplied from the _Serapis_.

The remaining officers and crew of the _Richard_ were transferred
to the _Alliance_, except the French volunteers; and the French
volunteers and marines on the _Alliance_ were sent to the _Serapis_,
as it had been arranged that no French subject was to remain on
the _Alliance_. Until the 27th of December the ship's company and
mechanics from shore were busily employed in making necessary
repairs, refitting the rigging, making new yards, and altering the
old ones. Every effort was apparently made to get the ship ready for
sea. Gales of wind and rotten cables placed her often in peril. Her
bottom being foul, the ship was careened and the bottom scrubbed.

The English kept a squadron cruising off the port, but Jones
determined to get to sea as soon as the weather would permit. He
thought he had recovered the trim of the ship which had been lost
under Landais. He states that the ship was well manned, and would not
be given away; that the Holland squadron had been drawn up ready for
battle for more than a month to drive him out if he should attempt to
remain after the wind became fair, while the English fleet was almost
constantly in sight of the harbor.

He was requested by the Dutch Admiral to declare whether the
_Alliance_ was a French or an American vessel, and if French to
display the French flag, and to omit no occasion of departing. To
this Jones replied, declining to display French colors, and saying
that he would get to sea whenever a pilot would take the ship out of
the harbor.

On the 27th of December, the wind serving, he set sail from the
Texel, fell foul of a Dutch merchant ship, lost the best bower-anchor
and cable, and had other mishaps, owing to the ignorance or
drunkenness of the old pilot.

The _Alliance_ passed along the Flemish banks, got to windward of
the enemy's fleet in the North Sea, and passed through the Strait of
Dover in full view of the enemy's fleet in the Downs. He then ran the
_Alliance_ past the Isle of Wight, in view of the enemy's fleet at
Spithead, got safe through the Channel, and cruised about the Bay of
Biscay and Cape Finisterre, overhauling many neutral ships and making
a few unimportant prizes. On the 17th of January he came to anchor
in the harbor of Corunna, Spain. Here he remained until the 28th of
January. He received and entertained visitors; again careened the
ship and scrubbed her bottom; made changes in her spars; obtained a
new anchor; and gave his men liberty. The men were complaining that
their wages and prize money had not been paid, and were in a mutinous
condition. On the 19th of January they all refused doing duty, but
Jones succeeded in satisfying them, and they returned to duty the
following day.[12]

[Footnote 12: See log of _Alliance_ for January 19, 1780.]

On the 28th of January, after entertaining the governor, the
_Alliance_ again put to sea, and cruised in the neighboring waters,
overhauling several ships, capturing a few unimportant prizes. She
met the American letter-of-marque ship _Livingston_, and in company
with her anchored within the Isle of Groix on the 11th of February,
and on the 19th moved up to the harbor of L'Orient, and moored the
_Alliance_ to the King's Moorings.

Jones' first object now appears to have been to repair and refit
the ship and make extensive alterations, the extent and cost of
which were the subject of remonstrance on the part of Benjamin
Franklin, who positively forbids his sheathing the ship's bottom
with copper, buying new canvas and cordage, thus adding to the
extraordinary expenses already incurred in Holland, especially as
Jones seemed to impute the damages the _Alliance_ had sustained more
to Landais' negligence than to accidents of the cruise; Franklin
concludes his admonitions with an appeal to Jones--"For God's sake be
sparing unless you mean to make me a bankrupt, or have your drafts
dishonoured for want of money in my hands to pay them."[13]

[Footnote 13: Richard C. Sands, Life and Correspondence of John Paul
Jones, New York, 1830, p. 248.]

Notwithstanding this appeal for economy, from the 19th of February
to the 12th of June the _Alliance_ remained at anchor at L'Orient,
and the repairs, renewals, and refitting were prosecuted with energy
by the crew of the ship, assisted by carpenters and mechanics from
shore. The log relates the work done day by day with some precision.
The essential repairs were completed in April, and Jones states that,
when finished, judges allowed that everything about the frigate was
perfect, and that he knew not what was the amount of disbursements.
In his journal for the King he says: "She was thought one of the
completest frigates in France."

Meantime, it was Mr. Franklin's intention to send the _Alliance_
back to America with large supplies of arms and clothing. Mr. Arthur
Lee, one of our commissioners, also desired to return in her. Landais
was annoying Franklin with importunities to such an extent that the
latter wrote Jones that he was determined to have nothing further to
do with him.

On the 4th of March Franklin wrote the President of Congress that
Jones would carry the _Alliance_ home, and that Landais had not
applied to be replaced in her, but on the 17th of March he asked
Franklin to be replaced in command of the _Alliance_. To this request
Franklin replied that he considered him so imprudent, so litigious
and quarrelsome a man, that if he had twenty ships-of-war in his
disposition, he would not give him command of one of them. Franklin,
on the 18th of March, states that he knew of nothing to prevent Jones
from proceeding immediately to such part of North America as he could
reach in safety.

The prize-money question was in abeyance; Franklin in his letters
to Jones referred to it, and stated that the ships-of-war he had
taken were to be valued, the King intending to purchase them, but
that the muster-roll of the _Bon Homme Richard_ was wanting in order
to regulate the proportions to each ship. At the same time Franklin
authorized Jones to draw on him for 24,000 livres in advance to
the people of the _Bon Homme Richard_, and stated that M. LeRay de
Chaumont had authorized his correspondent in L'Orient to advance
100,000 livres for the Americans of the _Alliance_ and _Bon Homme
Richard_, on account.

This prize-money question, as shown by the voluminous correspondence
of the time, was a troublesome matter, the cause of dissension,
controversy, and insubordination amounting to mutiny in the ship's
company.

The subject is fully treated in the various biographies of Jones, and
it is unnecessary to do more than allude to it here. It was, however,
the cause which induced Jones to go frequently to Paris, ostensibly
to hasten proceedings for the adjustment of the claims for prize
money. In his absence on shore at L'Orient Captain Landais, acting
under the advice of Arthur Lee and Commodore Gillon, of the South
Carolina navy, took possession of the _Alliance_ on the 12th of June.
The log entry on that day is the last of the _Alliance's_ journal. It
forms a terse but accurate account of this extraordinary transaction.
A more detailed account, by a participant in this event, will be
found in the Appendix.[14]

[Footnote 14: Richard C. Sands, Life and Correspondence of John Paul
Jones, New York, 1830, pp. 265-267. See Appendix H for Nathaniel
Fanning's narrative of this transaction. Landais and his first
lieutenant, Degge, were both tried by a court martial held on the
_Alliance_, November, 1780, Captain John Barry, president; both were
sentenced "to be broke, cashiered, and rendered incapable of serving
in the American navy thereafter." The Board of Admiralty reported
to Congress, March 28, 1781, that the plans of Jones for bringing
clothing and stores to America were overset by Landais' misconduct,
and Jones was exonerated from all charges for the delay. Naval
Records of the Revolution, 1775-1788, Washington, 1906, pp. 170, 171,
173.]

It appears from the correspondence of Mr. Franklin that Landais had
been furnished with money to enable him to return to America for
trial upon the charges preferred by Jones, and Franklin had, in May,
expressed his astonishment that he continued to remain at L'Orient.
To this Landais, on the 29th of May, coolly replied that he had been
waiting for orders to retake command of the _Alliance_! Franklin
replied to this, "I charge you not to meddle with the command, or
create any disturbance on board her, as you will answer the contrary
at your peril."

Arthur Lee, as well as Commodore Gillon, had previously quarreled
with Jones, and detested him. Lee, in a written opinion discussing
constitutional questions as to the authority of Congress, and that
of Mr. Franklin, advised Landais that he might lawfully treat our
minister's orders with contempt. As Jones was constantly absent from
his ship, spending much time in Paris, where he was the recipient of
marked attentions, it was not difficult for Landais to work upon the
mutinous spirit of the crew by charging Jones with neglect of their
interests regarding prize money due them, to such effect that they
addressed a letter to Franklin, signed by one hundred and fifteen
of the crew, declaring that they would not raise the anchor, nor
depart from L'Orient, until their wages and the utmost farthing of
their prize money had been paid them, and until _their legal captain,
P. Landais, was restored to them_. This mutinous document was
undoubtedly instigated by Landais; it bore unmistakable evidence of
being penned, and was forwarded to Franklin, by Landais himself.

On the morning of the 12th of June Jones, at L'Orient, assembled
his crew, before going on shore, and asked them if they could say a
word to his disadvantage. They answered that they could not, and,
according to Jones' account, showed every appearance of contentment
and subordination. Jones then went on shore, and Landais, taking
advantage of his absence, seized the command during the afternoon of
that day. Jones heard of the transaction from Dale, who informed him
that he and some others had just been turned ashore.

Jones immediately despatched by express to Franklin a statement of
the occurrence. Upon its receipt Franklin procured an order from
Versailles for the arrest and imprisonment of Landais, as a Frenchman
and subject to French laws. Lee, under whose legal advice Landais
had acted, wrote a long letter to Jones, in which he claimed that it
was clear that Landais commanded the _Alliance_ under the full and
express order of Congress, and no other authority existed which could
dismiss him from the command.

Some attempt was made by the commandant of the port to arrest Landais
and prevent the departure of the _Alliance_. Jones declined to employ
means to prevent her departure, interposing, he says, "to prevent
bloodshed between the subjects of allied powers." The _Alliance_
was hurried out of port with a mutinous crew--many of them in
irons--taking Arthur Lee and a number of civilians as passengers. On
the voyage homeward the officers and crew became dissatisfied with
Landais' conduct, and compelled him to relinquish the command. Mr.
Arthur Lee was particularly incensed against him, and principally
upon his testimony, on his trial by court martial, Landais was
dismissed from the service on the score that he was insane.

The conduct of Jones in thus abandoning his command has been
commented upon at length by his biographers, and variously accounted
for, the consensus of opinion being that, had he really wished to
recover the command, he could have gone on board the _Alliance_ with
his officers as soon as he heard that Landais had taken possession of
her, and would have met with no opposition from Landais, or, if he
had ventured upon personal violence, Jones, being in the right, would
not have been blamable for the consequences. The conduct of Jones
during this extraordinary transaction seems inconsistent with his
general character as a bold and determined fighter, and does not add
to his reputation.

Following the entry in the _Alliance's_ journal, recording the taking
possession of her by Landais, the log continues with "An account of
occurrences in L'Orient, respecting the _Bon Homme Richards_ Officers
& Crew" during the three days they were on shore waiting for orders.
On the 16th of June they were ordered to, and removed on board the
_Ariel_ frigate, that ship having been loaned by the French to assist
in transporting to America clothing and munitions of war, for which
room could not be found on the _Alliance_ and of which our army was
sorely in need. The _Ariel_ was a small frigate, formerly captured
from the English by the squadron under d'Estaing.

The log-book now contains

     A Journall Kept on Board the American Continental Ship
     of War, _Ariel_, of 26--Nine Pounders, Commanded by
     the Honble. John Paul Jones Esqr. commencing in the
     Port of L'Orient June the 16th: 1780.

Although under the date of the 16th, in the account of the
occurrences on shore, is written "Commencement of the _Ariels_
Journall," the first entry following the complete heading is on June
18th.

The remarks on the following days are full of interest. The ship
could hardly have been more than a hulk, in no way prepared for
sea, for until the 8th of October--nearly three months--they show
that she was remasted, sparred, altered, repaired, and refitted
with sails and new rigging, besides receiving on board quantities
of stores, clothing, and munitions of war, destined for America,
that the _Alliance_ had been unable to take. The movements of the
_Alliance_ under Landais are also recorded prior to her departure.
On the 2d of September a grand entertainment was given by Jones,
during which he endeavored to represent the battle with the _Serapis_
to a large and distinguished company. An amusing description of
another entertainment, about December 10th, appears in Fanning's
narrative,[15] who figures in the log entry on the 2d of September as
having been kicked by Jones and ordered below.

[Footnote 15: See Appendix E for Fanning's account of Jones'
entertainment. Although he states it to have occurred about December
10th, it probably is that recorded September 2d in the _Ariel's_ log.]

Although apparently ready for sea early in September, the ship was
moved only to the Roads of Groix, where she lay until the 8th of
October, apparently detained by contrary winds or foul weather. On
that day she got to sea, and on the very night of her departure
encountered a heavy gale which increased to a hurricane the following
day, in which the ship was nearly lost.

The remarks of the 9th and 10th of October describe the distress of
the ship, with some particularity for a formal log entry, but a more
detailed account of this great storm is found in a report signed by
the officers of the _Ariel_ which Jones procured, possibly to confirm
his own report of the gale and its effects, which he gives in his
journal for the King.

He sailed from the Roads of Groix with such a quantity of arms and
powder as filled the ship even between decks; the wind was fair
and weather pleasant, but the next night the _Ariel_ was driven by
the violent tempest close to the rocks of Penmarque, a terrible
ledge between L'Orient and Brest. The ship could show no sail, but
was almost buried under water, not having room to run before the
wind, and having several feet of water in the hold. Finding the
depth of water diminishing fast, Jones in the last extremity cast
anchor, but could not bring the ship's head to the wind. Sometimes
the lower yard-arms touched the water, and Jones had no remedy left
but to cut away the foremast. This had the desired effect, and the
ship immediately came head to the wind. The mainmast had got out of
the step, and now reeled about like a drunken man. Foreseeing the
danger of its either breaking off below the gun-deck or going through
the ship's bottom, Jones ordered it to be cut away, but, before
this could be done, the chain plates gave way, and the mainmast
breaking off by the gun-deck carried with it the mizzenmast, and the
mizzenmast carried away the quarter-gallery; two additional cables
were spliced and veered out. In that situation the _Ariel_ rode in
the open ocean to windward of perhaps the most dangerous ledge of
rocks in the world, for two days and two nights, in a tempest that
covered the shore with wrecks and dead bodies, and that drove ships
ashore from their anchors, even in the port of L'Orient.[16]

[Footnote 16: See Appendix G for Fanning's account of the storm which
wrecked the _Ariel_.]

This terrible gale was felt nearly all over Europe. In the
_Gentleman's Magazine_ for November, 1780, it is stated that "this
dreadful hurricane was one of those tremendous tempests of which two
or three occur in an age." In England it occurred on the night of
Sunday, October 8th, and did immense damage by sea and land. It is a
singular coincidence that, while Jones was experiencing this dreadful
hurricane on the French coast, his opponent of a twelvemonth before
equally felt its effects on the English coast.

In a letter to the Admiralty, dated on board the _Alarm_, at
Plymouth, October 10, 1780, Sir Richard Pearson states as follows:

     I arrived here on the evening of the 8th, it blowing
     very hard at S. E.; the next morning the wind shifted
     suddenly to W. N. W. and blew a gale all yesterday
     from that to W. S. W. and S. W. and continued until
     one or two o'clock this morning; in which I had the
     misfortune to part my two Bowers and Sheet Cable,
     and was reduced to my spare anchor, which I had
     providentially got two cables on, which brought me
     up at eleven o'clock last night, when I found myself
     under the necessity of cutting away all my masts
     for the preservation of his Majesty's ship and the
     lives of my people. I am now in the same distressing
     situation as I was last night.[17]

[Footnote 17: This letter is taken from the papers deposited in the
British Museum, known as the Filkin Manuscripts, in ten note-books.
They contain an extensive collection of memoranda--extracts from
magazines, newspapers, contemporaneous publications, and Admiralty
documents--collected by Mr. Filkin with the intention of writing
another Life of Paul Jones. Mr. Filkin dying, his note-books were
presented to the British Museum. Full copies of them are in the
editor's collection.]

The storm continuing until the morning of the 10th, notwithstanding
the heavy sea Jones succeeded on that and the following day in
getting up jury, fore, and mizzen masts, and on the 11th, at noon,
cut the cable, got under way, and anchored the _Ariel_ on the 13th of
October in the harbor of L'Orient.

The journal of the _Ariel_ ends on the 14th of October. She remained
at L'Orient until the 18th of December, when she again sailed, and
arrived safely in the United States, having encountered an enemy's
ship, supposed by Jones to be named the _Triumph_, which, after a
short resistance, struck her colors, and a few minutes afterward
(according to Jones) her captain had the baseness to fill his sails
and run away. This voyage in the _Ariel_ was the last service at sea
performed by John Paul Jones under the American flag. He arrived in
Philadelphia on February 18, 1781, having been absent from the United
States three years, three months, and eighteen days.

Following the last entry of the _Ariel's_ log, several leaves
have been torn out. The book was reversed again, and immediately
following "A List of The Men Names that has Desarted from The _Bone
Homme Richard_, Lorient July, 19th. 1779" we find, in the identical
handwriting of the logs of the _Serapis_, _Alliance_, and _Ariel_,
"A List of Officers, & Men, belonging to the American Continental
Ship of War, _Ariel_, Commanded, by the Honble, John Paul Jones."
A comparison of this list with the muster-roll of the _Bon Homme
Richard_ shows that most of the officers and many of the crew of the
former still followed the fortunes of Jones.

Upon several pages are also inscribed the following receipts:[18]

[Footnote 18: From these receipts it would appear that the _Queen of
France_ was formerly the _Count d'Artois_. The James Dick who signs
one of the receipts had served on the _Lexington_ as midshipman, had
been a prisoner of war in Mill Prison, was exchanged, and served
on the _Alliance_ with Dale. See Calendar of Jones Manuscripts, p.
182. There were seven privateers or letters-of-marque named _Queen
of France_, of which the bonds are listed in the papers of the
Continental Congress in the Congressional Library.]

     Recd. from Capt. Richard Deal the sum of Twenty one
     pounds seventeen and sixpence for thirty five days
     work on Board the Ship _Count De Artois_. July 27.
     1782.

                                                     Theobald Jennings

and

     Reserved, August the 11--1782 of Mr. Richard Dale
     twenty Eight pounds as an Advance to gow in the Ship
     _Queen of France_----

     £28.00.00.

                                                            James Dick

Another log is also contained in the book. It immediately follows the
"List of the Officers and Crew of the _Ariel_," and is headed, "A
Journal Kept on Board the Ship _Queen of France_, from Cape Henlopen
towards Lorient." Beginning on August 20, 1782, it records the
courses, distances run, the latitudes and longitudes of each day, up
to and including September 10th, when the ship was in latitude 47°
19' N. and longitude 19° 15' W. There are no entries in the column
under "Remarks."

Importance is attached to this log because it shows conclusively that
the book was in the possession of Dale until the end of the cruise of
the _Queen of France_, in February, 1783, about the time of the end
of the Revolution.

From Cooper's "Life of Richard Dale" we learn that after his return
to the United States in the _Ariel_ Jones was anxious to take him
with him to the ship _America_, to which Jones had been appointed,
but Dale declined the service and was employed on the _Trumbull_,
which was captured by an English fleet, and for the fourth time
Dale was made prisoner, but was exchanged in November, 1781. No
new service in the regular navy offering, Dale obtained a furlough
and joined a large letter-of-marque called the _Queen of France_,
that carried twelve guns, as her first officer. Soon after he was
appointed to the command of her and, in company with several other
letters-of-marque, sailed for France, making many captures by the
way. Dale's ship, however, parted from the fleet, and, falling in
with an English privateer of fourteen guns, a severe engagement
followed, in which both parties were much cut up, and they parted by
mutual consent.[19]

[Footnote 19: See Life of Richard Dale, by J. Fenimore Cooper,
Philadelphia, 1846, Vol. II, p. 257.]

Upon the termination of hostilities, in common with most of the
officers of the navy, Dale was "disbanded," and engaged in the East
India trade until 1792, when he was restored to the navy as captain
in the reorganized marine.

It was probably during this period that our log-book passed into the
possession of Jones, who was urging his claims for rank and prize
money before Congress.[20] Failing to obtain what he termed "proper
consideration," after a cruise with the French fleet Jones was
commissioned as agent to look after the prizes made on his cruises
in European waters and sailed for France November 10, 1783, in the
_Washington_, late _General Monk_, the ship captured by Barney in the
_Hyder-Ally_ and then commanded by Barney. Jones left in the care
of a Mr. Hyslop of New York a portion of his papers, being the same
which later turned up in the keeping of the baker in New York, and
upon which Sherburne based his life of Jones, and from him the logs
of the _Ranger_ and _Bon Homme Richard_ appear to have been purchased
in 1824 by Captain Boyd, before alluded to. But Jones took with him
those papers which he deemed most important to the discharge of his
mission to France, not the least of which was the book containing
the muster-roll of the _Bon Homme Richard_, which probably was the
only authentic and official list then in existence, and indispensable
to the proceedings in the French prize courts.

[Footnote 20: For an account of Jones' efforts before Congress to
obtain higher rank on the navy list, see letter from Captain James
Nicholson to Captain John Barry, Appendix B.]

The papers and property of Jones, upon his death in Paris in 1792,
passed to his sister Mrs. Taylor, and upon them as a base followed
the Edinburgh "Life of Jones," also that by Sands--by all conceded to
be the best of the numerous biographies of Jones--while Sherburne's
book, published in 1825, is properly criticized as a chaotic
compilation, creating inextricable confusion in the mind of a reader.

There has always been some difficulty in finding a correct
muster-roll of the _Bon Homme Richard_.[21] The list published by
Sherburne he states is made from "official sources," and is shown
by the correspondence on the subject to have been made from "a
certified copy of a copy." This is undoubtedly the document now in
the Congressional Library, being a copy, written by a Frenchman,
of the muster-roll filed by Jones in the French prize courts and
certified to by him as correct. As this list corresponds with great
exactness to the muster-roll of the officers and crew of the _Bon
Homme Richard_, making due allowances for desertions, men sent away
in prizes, and possibly new enlistments, it seems evident that the
original basis of the lists was that contained in the log-book. The
names of the French volunteers and marines were not entered in the
muster-roll, but were probably ascertained by Jones in France, and
added to the copy filed by him.

[Footnote 21: See correspondence on the subject of the muster-roll
and prize money, Sherburne's Life of Jones, New York, 1851, pp. 266,
364, 365, 366.]

The editor has alluded to the fact that the logs of the _Serapis_,
_Alliance_, and _Ariel_, as well as the list of the officers and crew
of the _Ariel_, are all written by the same hand. The penmanship
is remarkably good, the orthography correct, showing the writer to
have had some pretensions to scholarship and clerical ability, much
more than that shown by either Dale or Lunt. It had been conjectured
that the writer was Midshipman Nathaniel Fanning, who served under
an appointment by Jones on the _Richard_, _Serapis_, _Alliance_,
and _Ariel_. He it was who, stationed in the maintop, threw, or
caused to be thrown, the bomb which, exploding on the gun-deck of the
_Serapis_, created such havoc as to have been largely instrumental in
bringing the action to a close.

Fanning has left a narrative of his life, in which he claims to have
been Jones' private secretary, and to have had close and intimate
relations with him. He also refers to the journal kept by him, and
the dates of the occurrences, as stated at length in his narrative,
correspond with some accuracy with the same events as recorded in the
several logs.[22] The journal of the _Ariel_ ceases when Fanning left
the _Ariel_, probably because of the slight misunderstanding recorded
in the _Ariel's_ log on the 2d of September, an occurrence which
sufficiently accounts for Fanning's severe criticisms of Jones, given
in his narrative, with frequent allusions to his ungovernable temper.

[Footnote 22: Narrative of the Adventures of an American Navy Officer
who served during part of the American Revolution under the Command
of Com. John Paul Jones, New York, Printed for the author, 1806.]

Another reason for the conjecture arose from the fact that the name
of Nathaniel Fanning, as well as that of Beaumont Groube, both in the
muster-roll of the _Richard_ and the _Ariel_, are in the unmistakable
handwriting of the penman of the logs. As opposed to the conjecture,
however, the name of Nathaniel Fanning is spelled Fenning in the
_Richard's_ list, while in that of the _Ariel_ it is correctly
spelled.

This caused the editor to make further investigations, as it was
apparent that if Fanning was not, possibly Midshipman Groube was, the
writer of the logs, particularly as he had been considered competent
to act as judge-advocate of a number of courts martial, and,
inferentially, was a better scholar than other officers under Jones'
command.

Availing himself of the cordial assistance of Mr. Putnam, the
Librarian of Congress, and Mr. Hunt, chief of the Manuscripts
Division, the editor procured a facsimile of a long letter written
by Beaumont Groube to Captain Bell, commanding the privateer
_Luzerne_, then at L'Orient, dated May 3, 1780, when both Groube and
Fanning were attached to the _Alliance_, asking his good offices in
accommodating a quarrel with Lieutenant Degge, one of the officers
then on the _Alliance_.

Upon comparison of the penmanship of this letter with that of the
logs, it was established, beyond any possible doubt, that Midshipman
Groube was the scribe of all three logs, the handwriting being
identical.[23]

[Footnote 23: For facsimiles of a page in the _Serapis'_ journal, and
letter of Midshipman Beaumont Groube, see pp. xxxvi-xxxviii.]

There is a certain amount of interest attached to Midshipman Groube,
growing out of the fact that there are a great many contemporaneous
prints which represent Jones in the act of shooting a Lieutenant
Grubb for attempting to haul down the colors of the _Richard_. As
there was no Lieutenant Grubb in the ship, Groube has been made, by
writers of numerous chap-books, the victim of this act of Jones.
These chap-books are mainly fabrications of their authors and
engravers, and may properly be called the "dime novels" of the period.

Groube probably returned to the United States with Jones in the
_Ariel_, although he discontinued keeping the log on the 14th of
October, 1780. He seems to have disappeared, as no further trace
of him can be found, nor is there any account of his previous
life. It is evident, however, that he was a young man of good
education, as shown by his handwriting and correct spelling--unusual
accomplishments of the sailors of that period--as well as from his
selection as judge-advocate of the many courts martial held on the
officers and men of the _Richard_[24] when that ship was fitting for
sea at L'Orient.

[Footnote 24: Calendar of Jones Manuscripts, in Library of Congress,
pp. 98, 99.]

The editor would call attention to the fact that, although the
greater part of Jones' voluminous correspondence is now deposited
in the Library of Congress, Mrs. Taylor, or her daughter Jeanette
Taylor, parted with many interesting documents, and there are also
to be found in the hands of individuals many others which have never
been published. Besides the log-books here printed--as well
as the log-books of the _Ranger_ and _Bon Homme Richard_ heretofore
referred to--Miss Taylor informed Mr. Cooper that she had given
Jones' original commission as lieutenant, dated August 8, 1776,
to some one in Scotland as an autograph of President Hancock. The
original certificate of Hancock, appointing him to the command of the
_Providence_, is in the editor's collection, while his commission,
dated October 10, 1776, of which Sherburne in his edition of 1851
prints a facsimile, is now in private hands.

     On the following four pages are reproduced for the
     purpose of a comparison of the handwriting facsimiles
     of the first page of the _Serapis'_ log, and opposite
     it a page from a letter by Beaumont Groube. On the two
     subsequent pages are the continuation of the letter
     and a page from the ship's muster-roll. Almost at a
     glance it can be seen that the two signatures were
     written by the same hand and that the writing in
     the log and that in the letter are identical as to
     penmanship.

[Illustration: Facsimiles of the first page.]

Miss Taylor also presented to a relative the original certificate
of Jones' membership in the Society of the Cincinnati, signed by
Washington, dated October 31, 1785, which is now owned by Colonel
N. Arnott of Edinburgh, a descendant of the Paul family.[25]
The original commission of Jones authorizing him to arrange the
difficulties with the Barbary powers is in the remarkable collection
of Mr. Grenville Kane, of New York. Eighteen autograph letters from
and to Jones are now offered for sale by a London dealer for the
modest sum of $5,000; these evidently escaped from the Taylor family.

Paul Jones, by Francis Caird Inglis, F.S.A. Scot., 1906, p. 18.]

The editor has deemed it not uninteresting, although not immediately
connected with the principal object of this publication, to refer to
the dispersion of Jones' letters and public documents, and to print
in the Appendix an interesting letter to Commodore Esek Hopkins,[26]
also a letter from Captain James Nicholson to Commodore John Barry
relating to Jones' efforts before Congress to be placed at the
head of the navy, both of which are in the editor's collection of
manuscripts. In the Appendix will also be found a copy of a letter
of Jones, addressed to John Wendell--which as a composition may
be considered as one of the most remarkable of all his epistolary
effusions. The original letter is now in the possession of the
Wendell family. None of these letters have ever been published.[27]

In concluding this preamble to the logs, it will be noted that the
editor has supplemented the ship's stories by drawing largely upon
the accounts of the events, barely touched upon in the remarks to
be found in the numerous biographies of John Paul Jones, and upon
the papers relating to his career now deposited in the Congressional
Library. This has been done because it was possible that, as the
biographies are out of print and rather scarce, they might not be
readily available to many of the readers.

The first authentic "Life of Jones," throwing aside the numerous
so-called chap-books, was that of André, published in French in
Paris, 1798, translated and republished in "Niles' Register" for
the year 1812. Following the discovery of Jones' letters, Sherburne
produced his first edition in 1825. The manuscript of this first
edition he sent also to John Murray in London, who caused it to be
edited by Disraeli, later the Earl of Beaconsfield, and published the
book in the same year, 1825.[28] The preface of this book, according
to the editor of the "Life of Disraeli," was the earliest appearance
of Disraeli as an author. Sherburne was aware of the existence of
the papers in the possession of the Taylor family, and endeavored to
obtain them; but his request was refused, as they were already in the
hands of the author of the Edinburgh "Life of Jones," published in
1830.

possession of John Henry Sherburne esq., Register of the Navy of
the United States. London: John Murray, Albemarle Street, MDCCCXXV.
Also, The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, by William
Flavelle Monypenny, New York, 1910, pp. 60-61.]

Then followed the "Life of Jones" by Robert C. Sands, from the
original letters and manuscripts in the possession of Miss Jeanette
Taylor--New York, 1830. Mackenzie's "Life," in 1845, and Cooper's
"Life," in 1846--both based upon Sands and Sherburne--contain but
few additional matters of interest. Sherburne's "Life," published in
1825, was so freely criticized that a second edition, corrected and
enlarged, was published in 1851.

Several other lives of Paul Jones, simply reproductions of the
foregoing, with illustrations, and in cheaper popular form, have also
appeared, worthy of place only in a bibliography. Later we have the
"Life" by Buell, which, although he calls it a history, is simply a
pleasing, popular romance.

The history of the logs here reproduced may be thought somewhat
obscure, being founded upon some conjectures, deductions, and
probabilities, as well as absolute facts. The editor purchased the
log-book at the sale of the library of Mr. S. L. M. Barlow, of New
York, in 1889, it being item No. 2760 in the catalogue prepared by
Mr. J. O. Wright. Mr. Wright states that Mr. Barlow acquired the book
through Mr. Harrisse or Mr. Stevens, of London, some time previous to
1869.

The portrait facing the title-page has been selected from the
numerous engraved portraits of Jones as not only the best authentic
likeness taken from life, excepting perhaps the bust by Houdon, but
the earliest in point of execution, having been drawn by a celebrated
artist, Moreau le Jeune, in May, 1780, when Jones was in command of
the _Alliance_, at L'Orient.

The portrait by Charles W. Peale, now in Independence Hall,
Philadelphia, was executed seven years later, and has been
reproduced many times. A comparison of the two with the Houdon
bust demonstrates at once that the Moreau le Jeune portrait is by
far the more faithful likeness, and of a greater personality than
Peale's painting, with which we are more familiar. The great number
of engraved contemporaneous so-called portraits of Jones attest the
interest attached to his career in Europe. Many of them are purely
imaginative, and exist in all forms of engraving from the grand folio
mezzotint to the absurd caricature, and have formed the special
object of pursuit by many collectors of Americana, with the result
of extraordinary values for the rare ones, including the one here
reproduced.

The most remarkable collection of Jones' portraits, and pictures
relating to Jones' career, is that of Mr. Grenville Kane, of New York.

The picture of the engagement is a rare print, and has been selected
instead of the more familiar one taken from the painting by Richard
Paton.

The original painting by Paton is owned by the heirs of Lord Amherst,
whose ancestral estate included Flamborough Head, off which the
famous battle was fought. It has recently been offered for sale for
the sum of £3000.

In concluding this introduction to the logs, it has been the editor's
purpose to avoid repeating the incidents of Jones' life related in
his numerous biographies or quoting literally from his voluminous
correspondence, but he has referred to them only in so far as they
seemed to be connected in some measure with the log stories. The
letters given in the Appendix have been copied from the originals and
have never before been printed, while the extracts from Fanning's
narrative are taken from a book of which very few copies are in
existence.

A reprint of this narrative has been contemplated by the executive
committee as one of the future publications of the Society, it being
the only known autobiography of a man and officer who served under
Jones in European waters.

It remains for the editor to express his acknowledgments to Mr.
Robert W. Neeser, the secretary of the Society, for his very able
assistance in the preparation of this volume for the press, in
correcting and revising the proof-sheets, and in verifying the
references.

To Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of the Congressional Library, and
his able assistants Mr. Gaillard Hunt and Mr. J. C. Fitzpatrick, the
editor's thanks are due for their interest and assistance, as well as
to Mr. Charles W. Stewart, the Librarian of the Navy Department.

The absence of Rear-admiral Goodrich, at whose instance the Naval
History Society was organized, this publication undertaken, and
whose coöperation was expected, has contributed to the delay in the
publication, for which the editor begs the indulgence of the members
of the Society.

_Remarks on Friday 24th.. September 1779_

The First part of this twenty four Hours clear and Pleasant Weather
with Moderate Breeses of Wind---- At 3 P.M. sent the small Schooner
with Mr. Lunt and A Number of Marines in her to Board a =Schooner=
Brigg to the Windward of us at 1/2 past Do. the Alliance hove out
a Signal and bore away we immediately fir'd a gun for the Schooner
to give over Chase and kept away---- at 4 sett Steering Sails fore
and aft (in Chase of two Ships) At 6 P.M. Hoisted a Blue flag Blue
Pendant & a Blue & Yellow Flag At 1/2 past Do. came up with the
largest Ship and engaged her; the Alliance engag'd the small Ship
which soon struck. Att 8 A.M. the Alliance came under our stern and
Rak'd us fore & aft. She then shot just ahead of us and did the like
again, we were all this time closely engag'd with our Antagonist
lying so near each other that our Yard Arms was within her's; at 10
P.M. She Struck her Colours and prov'd to be the Searuppus of 44 Guns
soon after She Struck her Main Mast fell over her side. The People
employed in putting fire out that had catch'd in several parts of the
Ship & in Pomping for we were very near sinking; The Ship that the
Alliance Took prov'd to be the Scarborough of 20 Guns

EDITOR'S NOTE: The foregoing are copies of the entries or Remarks
in "A Log Book for the Ship Bon Homme Richard, the Honorible John
Paul Jones Commander begun at L'Orient Saturday, 8th of May 1779,"
of which a typewritten copy is in the Navy Department Library, and
the original is supposed to be now in the possession of the Selkirk
family at St. Mary's Isle.

Facsimiles of the three Remarks of the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of
September are also in the Navy Department Library. The entries of
the 22nd and 23rd are in the _same_ handwriting, and of similar
orthography, as are the preceding Remarks in that log. The
handwriting of the Remarks on Friday the 24th is that of Lieut. Henry
Lunt, who also wrote the Remarks on the same day in the _Serapis'_
log book.

There are no entries in the column of Knots, F., Courses, Wind, for
which the pages are ruled, for those days.

If this log was the regular Ship's Journal, it is remarkable that it
should have been kept by a man whose handwriting and orthography were
so bad as to be decipherable with difficulty. That the record of the
transactions on the eventful 24th day of September on the _Richard_
and _Serapis_ and the following days should have been delegated to
Lieutenant Lunt and Midshipman Groube seems to have been thought
desirable by some one in authority.

Copy of a Letter from Captain James Nicholson to Captain John Barry,
Commanding U. S. Frigate _Alliance_.

                                          Philada. June 24th 1781.--

_Dr. Barry_,

After congratulating you on your safe arrival and success, I shall
without any apoligy relate to you what has been Transacting in this
Quarter relative to rank for this week past, it still hangs over our
head & requires every Exertion of Interest to prevent its taking
place. The Attempt has been bold & Daring and is only equaled by the
man who made it.

The Chevalier ever since his arrival in this City has devoted his
time, privately, by making personal application to the Individual
members of Congress to give him rank at the head of our Navy, and
after Interesting (by being an accomplished Courtior), every member
who was week, or of his own stamp in his favor, hands into Congress a
Narritive of his services from the beginning of time containing the
best part of a Quire of paper, and attended with a modest petition
seting forth the injustice he had done him in the Establishment of
rank and desire of redress &ca. This had the desired effect, and he
had a Committee of Congress consistg. of Genl. Vernon, Mr. Mathews &
Mr. Clymer appointed to enquire into his Claim and to make report,
they accordingly did and in his favor. Congress was upon the point
of taking the report up, and I have too much reason to believe woud
have gratified the hight of his ambition had we not by the greatest
accident discovered it, this was done by information a member of
Congress gave Mrs. Reade in whose house he lived, he was also on the
most familiar terms with myself, so far he had proceeded without
the least suspisian on our side. As soon as I was informed of it,
I immediately took my Hat and with very little Ceremony waited
on the President of Congress at his house, & informed what I had
heard, he received me politely & told me my suspisians was just, I
therefore desired as my right that Congress might delay determining
on it untill Cap. Reade & myself in behalf of ourselves & the absent
brother officers equally concerned, should have an opportunity of
being heard, which he promised me his Interest to have done, and that
day Cap. Reade & myself threw in our remonstrance to Congress a Copy
of mine you have Enclosed, the Consequence of which was the Committee
was ordered to reconsider it and to give us notice to attend, we
according did & found Cap. Jones without doors in conferance with
two of them, Cap. Jones did not attend, I desired the Chairman would
send for him, the reason I assigned was that I would say many things
in his presence that I would not in his absence, he sent word that
he would wait on us but never came, we found the President & Mr.
Mathews predetermined in his favor, but Mr. Climer otherwise, after
pointing out the absurdity of his claim which proceeded from a
Brevial from Commodore Hopkins to the Command of the Sloop Providence
were from his own claim, Capts. Whipple, Hallock, yourself, &
Alexander where Capts. before him. I say after pointing out this to
them, the Presidt. appeared to be convinced, but if so in reality
I wont pretend to say. We had a good deal of conversation with the
Committee, Mr. Mathews alone seemed his most strenious advocate and
in my oppinion behaved obstinate & ungentiel. I said many things
pretty severe of the Chevaliers private as well as Public Carrector
too odious to mention and yet unnoticed, upon the whole we acquited
ourselves well. It happened five days ago and they have not yet made
their report. Should it be in his favor again, I have some reason
to believe the honest part as well as those who had been imposed on
from their ignorance about our Naval Transactions and the method
of Establishing rank, are now sufficiently alarmed, and should the
report be taken up at all, they will not determine in his favor.
Your arrival & success came very opportunily and I did not fail to
make use of it I mean outdoors in presence of Cap. Jones & some of
his advocated Members, by observing that you had acquit yourself
well, which they acknowledged. I then told them they could not do
less than make you Admiral also. I had not a sentense of reply. it
irritated the Chevalier so much that he was obliged to decamp. I
yesterday was informed by a Member of Congress a friend of mine that
they had received a letter from Bob Morris (The Financier) that he
would undertake to Fitt out immediately my Ship & the 74 and if they
agreed to it, there would be a necessity for appointing a Cap. to
her immediately, and at the same time asked if I would accept of
the Command of her. I refused but at the same time pointed out the
necessity of the next Senior officer having the offer & so down, and
in case none of them would accept untill it came to Chevalier that
then he should have the offer he seemed convinced from the arguments
I made use of of the Necessity of this mode as the only one that
would give satisfaction and make our Navy of repute. How it will
opperate with Congress I cant undertake to determine. I also let him
understand that you was already appointed to her. I have very good
reason to believe that Bob Morris' views are solely to serve him, but
be that as it may, he has my consent, as I am convinced he will never
get her to sea. It will suit his Vanity & only tend to expose himself
and his friends in Congress.

I have now 120 men onbd., and as Bob Morris has undertaken to supply
us with money expect to get to sea in a fortnight.

I now conclude with assuring you I remain Yrs most sincerely

                                                     Jas. Nicholson.


To His Excellency. the Presidt. & the Honble. the Members of the
United States in Congress Assembled.

The Memorial of Jas. Nicholson, Cap. in the Navy of the United States
Respectfully Shewith,

That your Memorialist has by accident been informed that the
Chevalier Paul Jones hath Petitioned Congress & in consequence
thereof a Committee has been appointed and are now actually siting
for the Purpose of considering his claim of Prior Rank to your
Memorialist, and as your Memorialist conceives any alteration in
the rank of the Navy as at present established will be doing him
a very sensible injury he begs leave to call the recollection of
Congress to their resolves of the 17th Ap. & the 10th Ocbr. of 76
by the latter of which the rank of every Cap. or Commander in the
Navy was established. Your Memorialist therefore prays that Congress
will not deprive him of the rank he has always held in the Navy of
the United States without a sufficient cause (which he presumes does
not exist) as it will convey to the Public at large a suspisian that
your Memorialist has forfeited that rank with which he has been so
long honored by some misconduct. As your Memorialist has not been
informed, certainly, upon what particular grounds Cap. Jones founds
his Claims of Prior Rank, your Memorialist can only refer to the
above mentioned Solemn Acts of Congress which sets forth the rank
that Honble. body fixed for every Cap. & Commdr. in the Navy. Your
MemorIt. has good reason to suppose it must be from his Early Service
should that be the Case. Your Memorialist begs leave to observe what
in his oppinion would be the Absurdity of Cap. Jones' claims viz;
That two of your Memorists. Lieutts. now under his immediate Command
onbd. the Trumbull would take the Commd. from your Memorits. & will
every Capn. Lieutt. that where in the Commodrs. fleet.

If it is thought necessary or proper to call the Congress from their
more Important business, your Memorits. has prepared and will furnish
a history of his services as a Public Off. prior to the Establishment
of rank, but he presumes that it is not necessary and depends
upon the Justice & Candor of Congress. Your Memorilst. therefore
begs leave to subscribe himself with profond respect & Esteem yr.
Excellency, most obedt. Humble. Servt. &ca.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Captain John Barry, to whom this letter was written,
was then in command of the _Alliance_, lying in Boston Harbor. He
had just returned from an eventful voyage to L'Orient, having taken
Colonel John Laurens to France as Special Commissioner of the United
States.




APPENDIX C.

Copy of Letter from Jones to Commodore Ezekiel Hopkins.

  The Honble. E. Hopkins Esquire
    Admiral of the American Fleet
      Rhode Island.
  P the Brig Sea Nymph
    Capt. W. Hopkins.

  Providence, at Sea in No Latd 37°. 40'
  and W. Longd. 54° Septr. 4th. 1776--

  _Honoured Sir_

I know you will not suspect me of flattery when I affirm that I
have not experienced a more sincere pleasure for a long time past
than the account I have had of your having gained your cause at
Philadelphia in spite of party.--Your late trouble will tend to your
future advantage; by pointing out your friends & Enemies you will be
thereby enabled to retain the one part while you guard against the
other.----You will be thrice welcome to your Native Land and to your
nearest concerns--after your late shock they will see you, as Gold
from the Fire, of more worth and Value, and Slander will learn to
keep silence when Admiral Hopkins is mentioned, but enough of this.

And now for my success--I sent in a Nantucket Whailer by Captn.
Grinnele 27th. Ulto.--She appeared by the voluntary testimony of the
master mate &ca to be the property of Rank Tories who had ordered
their Oil to be Carried to the London Market and the amot. of it to
be ship't out in English goods to Nantucket. Since that time I have
been further to the Southward when I brought too a number of French
Spanish & Danish Ships--but saw no Englishmen 'till the first Currt.
when I fell in with five Sail--one of them being very large we took
her to be either an Old East Indiaman or a Jamaica three Decker--but
she proved to be an English Frigate Mounting twenty six Guns upon one
Deck--She sailed fast and pursued us by the wind 'till after four
hours Chase, the sea running Very Cross, she got within Musquit Shot
of our Lee Quarter--as they had continued firing at us from the first
_without showing Colours_ I was angery at this low piece of Conduct
therefore ordered ours to be hoisted and began to fire at them--they
then hoisted American Colours and fired Guns to leeward--but the bait
would not take for having everything prepared I bore away across
his forefoot and set all our light sails at once so that before her
sails were trimmed and Steering-sails set I was almost out of reach
of Grape & soon after out of reach of Cannon Shot.--Our "Hairbreadth
Scape" and the saucy manner of making it must have mortified him
not a little--had he foreseen this motion and been prepared to
counteract it he might have fired several Broadsides while we were
within pistol shot--but he was a bad marksman and did not hit the
Providence with one of the many shot which he fired.--I met with no
other adventure 'till last night when I took the Brigantine Sea Nymph
bound from Barbados for London with a Cargo of two hundred and twenty
seven Hogsheads of Rum besides Oil Sugar Ginger and Madeira Wine---
I understand by this Brig that the A. Doria is off Bermuda and that
Captn. Weeks hath given a trimming to an English sloop of war off
Martinico.---- I am too late for West Indiamen but will not yet give
up hopes--I am much afraid that the Store Ships come out under Convoy
for who would have expected to find a Frigate with no more than two
Ships a Brig & a Sloop.

If I meet with further success I will write you in Course in the
meantime I rest assured that your good offices will not be wanting in
my favour when the Navy Rank and Seniority comes to be Settled--if I
was worthy of the Rank of Eldest Lieutenant of the Fleet I deserve
not to be superseded in favour of any person who then bore an
inferior or Juniour Commission.

It will be good policy if the Congress or Marine Committee fix the
Parity of Rank between land and sea Officers as it is on the English
Establishment Vizt. An Admiral ranks with a General a Vice Adml with
a Lieun. Genl. a Rear Adml. with a Major Genl. a Commodore with with
a Brigadeer Genl. a Captain with a Colonel a Master & Commander with
a Lieut. Colo, a Lieut. Commanding with a Major & a Lieutenant in the
Navy with a Captain of Foot or Marines--this would prevent numberless
disputes and deuelings which otherwise will be unavoidable--but I
remember that this agrees with your own opinion and therefore I need
use no argument to enforce it.--my best wishes and respects await
yourself and Family and I am with much Esteem and grateful Respect

  Honoured Sir

                            Your very Obliged and most humble Servt.
                                                       JNO. P. JONES

EDITOR'S NOTE: In a letter to Mr. Hewes, dated January 12, 1777,
Jones, in speaking of Hopkins, writes of the latter calling himself a
Commodore, "this _Commodore_ is altogether unfit to command a Frigate
of thirty-two Guns." See Calendar of Jones Manuscripts, Library of
Congress, pp. 15-16, 20-22.

Copy of Letter Addressed by Jones to John Wendell, Esqr., Portsmouth,
N. H.

                                       Ranger, Nantes 11th Decr. 1777.

_My dear Sir_,

The Ranger was wafted by the Pinions of the gentlest, and most
friendly Gales, along the Surface of the Blue profound of Neptune;
and not the swelling bosom of a Friend's nor even of an _Enemis
Sail_, appeared within our placid Horizon, untill after we had passed
the Everlasting Mountains of the Sea, (called Azores) whoe's Tops
are in the Cloud's, and whoe's Foundations are in the Center. When
lo! this Italeyon Season was interrupted! the "gathering Fleets
o'erspread the Sea" and Wars alarms began! nor ceased day or night
untill, aided by the mighty Boreus, we cast anchor in this Asylum
the 2d Currt. but since I am not certain that my Poetry will be
understood, it may not be amiss to add, _by way of marginal note_,
that after leaving Portsmouth nothing remarkable happened untill I
got to the Eastward of the Western Islands; and that from that time
untill my arrival here, I fell in with Ships every day sometimes
every Hour; within Eighty Leagues of Ushant, I met with an Enemies
fleet of Ten Sail bound up Channel, but notwithstanding my best
endeavours, I was unable to detach any of them from the strong
Convoy under which they sailed, I met with and brought too a variety
of other Ships, none whereof proved British Property, except two
Brigantines from Malaga with Fruit for London, which became Prizes,
the one is arrived here, the other I am told in Quiberon Bay; as I
have met with and brought too several Ships in the Night, I had the
most agreeable Proofs of the Active Spirit of my Officers and Men.

I have forwarded my dispatches to Paris, by Express, and determine
not to go myself unless I am sent for. I understand that in Obedience
to Orders from the Secret Committee the Commissioners had, some
time ago, provided One of the finest Frigates for me that can be
imagined, calculated for Thirty-two, Twenty four Pounders, on one
deck, and longer than any Ship in the Enemies Fleet; but that
it has been found necessary to give her up, on account of some
difficulties which they have met with at Court. My Heart glows with
the most fervent Gratitude for this, and every other unsolicited and
unexpected instance of the favo'r and Approbation of Congress; and if
a Life of Services devoted to the Interests of America, can be made
Instrumental in securing its Independance; I shall be the happiest
of Men, and regard the continuance of such Approbation, as an Honor
far superiour to the empty Peagantry, which Kings ever had Power to
bestow.

I esteem your Son as a promising and deserving young Man, I have
just now had some Conversation with him, and am much Pleased
with his diffidence and Modesty, he would not he says accept of a
Commission untill he thinks himself equal to the duty of the office
of Lieutenant; there I think he shows a true Spirit; in the mean
time, he tells me that he is perfectly satisfy'd with his present
Situation, anything within my Power to render his Situation happy and
Instructive, shall not be wanting.

I must rely on you to make my best Compliments receptable to the fair
Miss Wendell, and to the other agreeable Ladies of my acquaintance
in Portsmouth. The Captain of the Raleigh I understand is well, and
has lately been figuring it away at Paris, whereof please to acquaint
my _Sister_ Officer. I should be exceedingly happy to hear from
you, but as my destination depends on what I am to hear from the
Commissioners, I cannot at Present give you my Address, but will drop
you another, How do you do, shortly.

I am with Sentiments of Respect & Regard,

  My dear Sir,
                                               Your Obliged,
                                                  very Obedient,
                                                most humble Servant,
                                                       JNO. P. JONES

Peace at Portsmouth, N. H.




APPENDIX E.

Fanning's Account of an Entertainment Given by Jones on the _Ariel_.
Possibly the date is wrong. It may be that recorded in the _Ariel's_
log on "September 2nd. 1780----"


About the tenth of December Great preparations were made on board
of our ship in consequence of a great number of people of the first
characters in L'Orient. One prince of the blood royal, and three
French admirals, with some ladies of the first quality, having had
cards of invitation sent them by captain Jones, inviting them on
board of his ship the next day to take dinner with him precisely
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon; and also informing the company
that captain Jones would in the evening of that day, on board of
his ship, exhibit to them a sham sea fight; and that it should in
part represent his battle with the Serapis, particularly her tops.
To go through with a minute detail of all and every circumstance
that related to this scene would, I fear, tire the patience of the
reader; I shall therefore be as concise as possible in my relation
of this exhibition. First then, all the boats belonging to our ship
were busily employed with their respective crews from the time the
approaching scene was known on board, (which was the day before it
was to take place, at ten o'clock in the morning, till about twelve
at night on the day on which the company were to dine, in passing
to and coming from the shore, bringing off all the articles wanted.
And the reader may rest assured that neither cash nor pains were
spared in order that the scene every way should appear magnificent.
In a short time our quarter-deck had the appearance of a lady of
qualitie's drawing-room. Over head was suspended an elegant awning,
the edges of which were cut in scollops, and decorated with a variety
of silk roses, tassils, &c. from a little below the awning: at the
sides were hung thin canvass lined with pink coloured silk, and which
fell down so as to reach the quarter-deck. These sides were hung
with a great variety of French pictures and looking glasses; some
of the first had been drawn by one of the most finished artists in
France, and many of which were quite indecent, especially to meet
the eyes of a virtuous woman. However, in these days they made a
part of French etequette on such an occasion. The quarter-deck of
our ship was covered with the most elegant carpets, the plate alone
which was made use of on this singular occasion was estimated to
be worth two thousand guineas (for my own part I believe it might
have been rated at double that sum.) French cooks, and waiters or
servants, were brought from the shore to assist in this business
and for nearly twenty hours preceding the serving up of dinner, we
were almost suffocated with garlick and onions, besides a great
many other stinking vegetables. A French lady (who was said to
be a great connossieur in the art of cookery, and in hanging and
arranging pictures in a room where the first companies went to dine)
was gallanted on board by captain Jones the evening before the day
on which the company were to dine, and was by him directed to take
upon herself the superintendance of the approaching feast. The next
day was ushered in by thirteen guns, and the dressing of the ship
with the thirteen stripes, and the colours of all nations who were
friendly to the United States. Captain Jones and his officers were
all dressed in uniform, with their best bib and band on, and we
were directed by captain Jones to conduct ourselves with propriety
and to pay implicit obedience to my _lady superintendant_ of the
ceremonies. At a quarter before 3 o'clock in the afternoon the ship's
boats (three in number, each having a midshipman who acted for this
time as cockswains; and the men who rowed the boats were all neatly
dressed in blew broad cloth, with the American and French cockades in
their hats,) were dispatched on shore to bring on board the company.
Jones received them as they came up the ship's side and conducted
them to their seats on the quarter-deck with a great deal of ease,
politeness, and good nature.[30] Dinner was served up at half past
3 P.M. The company did not rise from table till a little after the
sun set, when captain Jones ordered his first lieutenant to cause
all hands to be called to quarters, which was done just before the
moon was rising. I of course, mounted into the main top, which had
always been my station as long as I had served under Jones (of which
and the men at quarters there, I had the command.) Orders were given
before we mounted into the tops that we must be well supplied with
ammunition blunderbusses, muskets, cowhorns, hand granadoes, &c. The
same as if we were now to engage with an enemy; and when the signal
was given (which was to be a cannon fired upon the fore-castle, and
as soon as the gun was fired, the sham fight was to commence.) At 8
o'clock it began, and lasted about one hour and a quarter without
any intermission. Such a cracking of great guns, swivels, small
arms, cowhorns, blunderbusses, &c. such a hissing and poping of hand
granadoes, stink pots, powder flasks, was now heard as they fell
into the water alongside, as was never the like in the harbour of
L'Orient, seen or heard. Some of the ladies were much frightened,
and the sham fight would have continued longer had it not been that
some of them intreated captain Jones to command the firing to cease.
The fight over, a band of music which had been ordered on board by
the commandant, and who had been paraded upon the fore part of the
quarter-deck, now played their part, and all was glee and harmony.
At about twelve at night the company took their leave of captain
Jones, and the boats set them safe on shore, in the same order and
regularity as they came on board, excepting a few who were landed
_half seas over_; these the midshipmen assisted along to their
lodgings, and returned on board to give an account to captain Jones
that we saw all the company safe at their respective places of abode.
For several days after this nothing of any note was to be heard in
conversation among the French at L'Orient, in their coffee houses and
private dwellings, but captain Jones's feast and sham fight. Upon
the whole, I believe it must have cost himself as well as the United
States a vast sum of money. There was certainly a great quantity of
powder burnt, and an abundance of wine (besides other liquors) drank.
The cost of the whole of this entertainment, including the powder,
amounted (by an estimate made by the American agent's first clerk,
and who it seems paid the cash for sundry bills relative to this
business, to 3,027 crowns at 6s. 8d. each, Massachusetts currency.)
Whether captain Jones charged the whole or any part of the expences
of this business to the United States I never learned.

distinguished from the rest by a brilliant star which he wore upon
his left breast.]




APPENDIX F.

The Continuation and End of the Voyage of the _Ariel_ to the United
States.


As the Journal of the _Ariel_ ends on the 14th day of October, 1780,
a brief account of her voyage to the United States, gathered from the
Biographies of Jones, may not be out of place.

Jones continued to prolong his stay at L'Orient more than two months
from the time of his putting back dismasted, and again received the
remonstrances of Franklin for the expenses incurred in the refitting
of the ship.

The arms destined for our army were so much damaged that they were
discharged and abandoned. During this period of delay, Jones was
much of his time in Paris, and beguiled his time in giving elegant
entertainments on his ship, one of which is recorded in the log
on the 2d day of September; the one given on or about the 10th of
December is described by Fanning, Appendix E. Fanning left the
_Ariel_ immediately after this entertainment, and soon after took
command of the privateer _Eclipse_, sailing out of Dunkirk.

The _Ariel_ sailed from L'Orient on the 18th of December, bound for
Philadelphia, and had an eventful voyage. Owing to the lumbered
condition of his ship, Jones was not particularly anxious to meet the
enemies' cruisers. A conspiracy was discovered amongst the English
part of the crew, to take the ship, to defeat which the officers
and passengers prepared to defend themselves. Jones followed an
unfrequented track, taking the southern passage along the edge of the
trade winds. When in latitude 26°, near the meridian of Barbados, a
large sail was discovered, apparently a cruiser, from which Jones
endeavored to escape, but failed. The ships came close alongside,
both displaying English colors. A conversation ensued, and the
stranger proved to be a British ship named _Triumph_. A sharp action
took place within pistol shot, when the _Triumph_ struck her colors,
and cried for quarter, but the _Triumph_, having got on the weather
bow of the _Ariel_, made all sail and escaped. The _Triumph_ was
undoubtedly a privateer, not a King's ship. After this action, twenty
of the ringleaders in the plot to get possession of the ship were
identified, and put in irons. No further incidents of note occurred,
and the _Ariel_reached Philadelphia on the 18th of February, 1781.




APPENDIX G.

Fanning's Account of the Storm which Wrecked the _Ariel_.


On the 7th of October, 1780, we set sail from this port for the
United States in the Ariel, at about 6 P.M. and at the time we had
under our convoy fourteen sail of American vessels, among which
were three letters of marque, with the wind blowing a leading gale,
at E.S.E. At 10 P.M. the wind shifted suddenly into the W.S.W and
blew a heavy gale--took in top gallant sails, and close reefed our
top sails--soon after took in our topsails and reefed our courses,
and we carried them as long as the ship would bear them. The night
was very dark, and we lost sight of the fleet. We were obliged to
carry some sail in order to weather the _Pin Marks_, a long range of
sunken rocks about a league from the land, and which we judged to be
to leeward of us. At midnight we were obliged to hand our courses,
as it blew so violent that we could not suffer a single yard of
canvass. The ship at the same time lay in a very dangerous situation,
nearly upon her beam ends, and in the trough of the sea, and leaked
so bad that with both chain pumps constantly going we could not
keep her free. Some French soldiers which we had on board, and who
were stationed at the cranks of the pumps, let go of them, crossed
themselves, and went to prayers. They were driven from this by the
officers to the cranks again; and it became necessary to lift hangers
over their heads, and threaten them with instant death if they quit
their duty, or if they did not work with all their strength; without
this they would again leave off and go to prayers. Soon after, one
of our chain pumps got choked in such a manner that it would deliver
no water. Jones in all this time shewed a great presence of mind,
and kept, with his own hands, sounding with the deep sea lead; and
finding that we were shoaling water very fast, and that we should in
a short time be upon the Pin Marks, without something was soon done
to prevent it. In this extremity a consultation of captain Jones
and his principal officers was had upon the quarter-deck, and the
result was, that orders were given for cutting away our fore-mast and
letting go the sheet anchor; and the latter was executed without loss
of time. We sounded now in thirty-five fathoms of water. The sheet
cable was now paid out to the better end; but she did not look to
her anchor; another cable was spliced to the first, and paid out to
the better end; she did not yet bring up; the third cable was also
spliced to the end of the second; when after paying out about seven
eighths of this last, and the fore-mast cut away at the same time,
and when it had fell over board to the leeward, the ship brought to
and rid head to the wind, and the sea now run mountains high.[31]
By the time of which I am now speaking we had not less than three
hundred fathoms of cable paid out--in a few minutes after the ship
brought to to her anchor. The ship laboured so hard, rolled so deep,
and would bring up so sudden that it sprung our main-mast just
below our gun-deck, and as this was now in the greatest danger of
being ripped up, orders were given to cut away the main-mast above
the quarter-deck, which was immediately carried into execution; and
when this fell over the side to leeward it forced off the head of the
mizzen-mast. By this time, we had freed the ship of water, but when
her masts were gone her motion was so quick and violent that the most
expert seamen on board could not stand upon their legs, neither upon
the quarter-deck nor fore-castle without holding on to something. The
chain pump which had been choked was cleared, and notwithstanding the
gale kept increasing, yet our anchor and cables held on so well, that
some faint hopes were now entertained that our lives would be spared:
however, the gale did not abate much until the morning of the 9th. At
meridian of this day the wind had abated so much that we began to get
up and rig our jury masts. At 4 P.M. we had them erected and rigged,
and what spars and sails we could muster upon them; and there being
at this time but a moderate breeze at about W.N.W, a fair wind for
L'Orient, and the sea tolerable smooth, we hove in our cables till
it was short apeak, and then exerted ourselves every way we could
think of in order to purchase our anchor, and after trying a long
time without being able to weigh it, orders were given by captain
Jones to save all we could of the cable and then cut it away, which
was done and we made sail for L'Orient, where we soon after arrived
and came to anchor. Many of our friends now came on board to see us,
and appeared to be rejoiced at our safe escape, as they said, they
expected we were lost, as the late gale was very violent and did a
great deal of damage even in the harbour, among the shipping and
along side of the keys.

APPENDIX H.

Fanning's Account of the Taking Possession of the _Alliance_ by
Landais.


Great alterations were now made by the carpenters on board of the
Alliance frigate in almost every part of the ship, which put the
United States to a vast and unnecessary expence. However, Jones
was no so well suited with the command of her that he would have
everything done and altered to please his fancy on board of her; not
I presume, regarding what it cost, only as a secondary consideration.
The Alliance was however ready for sea by the middle of June, 1780,
and only waited for a wind to proceed to America.

About this time we heard that captain L----, who had commanded this
ship, had arrived in L'Orient, but it seems he went about that place
incog. He soon, notwithstanding this, came publicly forward upon
the stage and acted the part of a leading character as follows: One
day, (I think it was the 23d of June) at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
captain Jones's officers (who were not then on shore) were below
at dinner, and captain Jones had gone on shore to dine with the
commandant of that place. L---- 's officers at this time were nearly
all upon the quarter-deck (being no doubt in the plot) of which the
first knowledge we (who were down below) had of it, we heard above
three loud huzzas. Such a sudden manoeuver surprised us, and we got
upon the quarter-deck as soon as our legs could carry us. Here L----
was walking fore and aft with a paper in his hand, and the yards
were manned. He immediately gave orders to Mr. Diggs, formerly first
lieutenant to him, to cause all captain Jones's officers to come upon
the deck as he had something to say to them. They were all mustered
accordingly, and as soon as they made their appearance; he, holding
his commission in his hand at the same time, addressed them in nearly
the following words: 'Here, you see gentlemen, the commission that
the Congress did give me (as he did not speak very good English)
for this frigate, and you see I now command her; and that there is
no man in France who has a right to take this commission from me:
therefore, gentlemen, all you who do not acknowledge me to be captain
of this ship you must directly to the shore go, taking with you your
baggage and every thing which belongs to you.' Accordingly, there
was no other alternative left us but to obey these orders; so that
all the officers who had served on board of the Good Man Richard
under capt. Jones were forced to leave the Alliance, excepting one or
two who chose to remain on board. However, L---- forbid any of the
crew quitting her. The Alliance in about three quarters of an hour
after this, with the assistance of part of the crews of several men
of war then lying in the harbour, unmoored her, made sail, passed
the citadel without molestation, and came to anchor under the Isle
of Groix, without gun shot of any of the French fortifications.
Jones being on shore when this singular manoeuver took place, and
not hearing any thing of it till the Alliance was safe at anchor,
as I just observed. Never, I am confident, was a man so dreadfully
enraged. His passion knew no bounds; and in the first paroxism of
his rage he acted more like a mad man than a conqueror. However,
as he now saw that he was out-generaled by L---- his sworn enemy,
he at length became more calm. The French commandant, at whose
table he was sitting when he heard this news, offered him all the
assistance in his power, and he appeared to entertain some hopes of
getting the Alliance again into his possession. For this purpose
he obtained leave of the commandant and French general, to possess
himself of a row galley then lying at the key, and which mounted 2
eighteen pounders forward and one abaft, rowed with sixteen oars,
and was rigged with latine sails. He was also furnished for this
expedition with three hundred (if I am not mistaken) French troops,
who were partly embarked on board of the row galley, and the rest
on board of boats. Jones flattered himself that this force was able
to take the Alliance; and besides, he did not much expect that
captain L----, nor his officers and crew, would make any resistance.
He required all his old officers who had served under him, to join
and lend their assistance in this Don Quixote undertaking; but they
all declined having any thing to do with or acting in this affair,
excepting one of his lieutenants, who, had the honour of commanding
this expedition. He (Jones) very prudently declined embarking, which
in my opinion he ought to have done. In that case I have no doubt
but all his officers would have resigned their lives with him. Every
thing being in readiness, the little squadron moved out of the
harbour wearing American and French colours, and proceeded on towards
the Isle of Groix, where the Alliance was at anchor. The captain
of which,[32] sent a flag with a message to the commander of the
expedition the purport of which was, that 'If they came within the
reach of his cannon he would sink them.'[33] The little fleet then
lay upon their oars a few minutes, after which they turned tail and
returned back into port no wiser than when they set out upon this
wonderful expedition. Jones, upon seeing them return without taking
the Alliance was so enraged that he could hardly contain himself for
some time. He swore bitterly--he stamped--he cursed, and grew almost
frantic with rage. Three French ships of the line were lying in the
harbour at this time, and Jones with the help of the commandant,
endeavored to prevail with the French admiral to send out one or
two of those ships, (which had their sails bent and were ready for
sailing,) in order to force the Alliance to return back to port.
But the admiral refused, and told captain Jones that he should not
interfere in the quarrel between him and captain L----. Besides, he
assured captain Jones that it was more than his commission was worth,
taking his head into the bargain, for him to order the departure of
either of the ships under his command; more especially on such a
piece of service as that was, which captain Jones wished her to be
sent upon. The fact was, this same French admiral was at this very
time as deep in the _mud_ as L---- was in the _mire_; and so was the
commander of the citadel, commonly called Fort Lewis, or Louis. L----
had been to this last place sundry times, as well as on board of the
French admiral, where the plot or conspiracy was first agitated, of
taking the Alliance out of Jones's hands, and where it was brought to
maturity, and succeeded as I have related.

[Footnote 32: L---- had been apprized of their coming to take them,
and was prepared to give them a warm reception, all hands being at
quarters.]

[Footnote 33: They were about a mile from the _Alliance_.]
